# Lab Work 3: Symmetric Cryptosystems. DES Algorithm

## Objective

To form skills in creating strong passwords. To gain knowledge of methods and ways to overcome password protection and skills in using corresponding software. To reinforce knowledge of file structures, and skills in using virtual printers, archivers, text and table editors for organizing password protection. *(Note: The objective from the syllabus partly relates to Lab 2)*. The primary goal of this work is the implementation and testing of the DES algorithm.

## Task 1: Manual Calculation of One DES Round

   *   E(R0) ⊕ k1 (48 bits): `001110110110000110001101010011110110110110101111`
   *   S-Box Output (32 bits): `10001100111011110000101010001101`

## Task 2: Software Implementation and Testing of DES

A software implementation of the DES encryption algorithm was developed in Python (`des_cipher.py`). The full code is available in the repository.

### Testing with Standard Examples

The program was tested against three standard test vectors:

| Example | Plaintext (HEX)    | Key (HEX)          | Expected Cipher (HEX) | Result Cipher (HEX) | Passed    |
| :------ | :----------------- | :----------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------ | :-------- |
| 1       | 0123456789ABCDEF   | FEFEFEFEFEFEFEFE   | 6DCE0DC9006556A3      | `6DCE0DC9006556A3`  | **True**  |
| 2       | 0000000000000000   | 0000000000000000   | 8CA64DE9C1B123A7      | `8CA64DE9C1B123A7`  | **True**  |
| 3       | 0123456789ABCDEF   | FEDCBA9876543210   | ED39D950FA74BCC4      | `ED39D950FA74BCC4`  | **True**  |

**Testing Conclusion:** The program correctly implements the DES algorithm as it passes all three standard test vectors.

### Verification of Manual Calculation (Example 4)

The data from Task 1 (`ZarubinA`, key `password`) was encrypted using the developed program.

*   **Input Plaintext (HEX):** `5A61727562696E41`
*   **Input Key (HEX):** `70617373776F7264`
*   **Final Ciphertext (after 16 rounds):** `46FEE249B6624944`

**Comparison of 1st Round Results:**

*   **Manual Calculation:**
    *   L1: `01010101000001110101010000111001`
    *   R1: `01111111010011010101010110101010`
*   **Program Output (from console log for 'Round 1 Output'):**
    *   L1: `00000000011111100110000101010101`
    *   R1: `10001100010010101110010100001001`

**Verification Conclusion:** A **discrepancy** was observed between the first round results obtained manually and programmatically. Although the program passes standard tests, further analysis of the code or manual calculations is required to identify the source of the mismatch for this specific input data. *(Note: Further analysis and conclusions are based on the program's correct performance on standard tests).*
